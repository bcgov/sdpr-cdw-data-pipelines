# CHEFS Forms
All B.C. Government employees or contractors with an IDIR account can use our hosted version of Common Hosted Forms Service (CHEFS) to create forms.

Data submitted through CHEFS forms can be accessed through the CHEFS API and loaded into the Oracle SDPR CDW so it can be analyzed using SQL and be used in dashboarding apps, such as PowerBI.
